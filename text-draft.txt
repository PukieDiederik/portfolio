About

Hi, my name is Diederik. I'm 17 years old and currently live in the netherlands. I've dropped out of highschool because of mental problems.
I've been learning about programming by myself and I feel like i've learned a lot so far. When there are things that I haven't learned yet I can make them my own quickly.


Education
  - C#
    This is one of the first programming languages I have learned. I have used this together with Unity3D but also stand-alone. 
    It is my prefered strong typed language and I will use this whenever I need a more robust language.

  - Web dev
    I have a decent understanding of both the front and backend of websites/web applications. I used this(INSERT LINK HERE) course to learn about web dev. 

  - NodeJS
    This is my prefered framework when working with web apps. I have used this in the past for a discord bot but also to create my own websites.

  - Python
    This is my preferred language when something needs to be done quickly or dirty. I can write scripts using this to automate simple tasks.

  - Opengl
    Even though I haven't used it much I do understand the fundamentals of graphics programming.

  - Datastructures
    I've studied datastructures using this video(INSERT LINK HERE). It shows the fundamentals of datastructures and how they can be applied.

  - Unity
    I have experience with unity and have used this (together with other people) to do game-jams.

  - Git

Projects
  - Discord disconnect bot
    This is a simple bot for Discord which allows users to disconnect themselves after a while.

  - Sha256
    This is just a simple Sha256 algorithm which will hash a string or a file for you.

  - Sudoku
    This is a sudoku solver using depth first search in C#. It allows you to input a 81 character long number (a 9x9 sudoku flattened where empty cells are 0) and it will solve it for you.

  - Sudoku.py
    This is a sudoku solver written in Python. It allows you to input a sudoku as a 81 character long number and it will solve it for you.

  - Weather app
    This is a weather app written in python with PyQT5. I used this project to learn how to create a frontend using python.4
